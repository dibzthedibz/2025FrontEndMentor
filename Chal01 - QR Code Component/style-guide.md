# Front-end Style Guide

# Layout

    The designs were created to the following widths:

    - Mobile: 375px
    - Desktop: 1440px

    > ðŸ’¡ These are just the design sizes. Ensure content is responsive and meets WCAG requirements by testing the full range of screen sizes from 320px to large screens.

#            1. Flexible Layouts and Reflow (Success Criterion 1.4.10 - Reflow)
##            â€¢	Content must adapt to smaller viewports without requiring horizontal scrolling for main content.
##            â€¢	Users must be able to view content on a screen width of 320 CSS pixels (mobile) and up to 400% zoom without losing information or functionality.
        ________________________________________
#            2. Text Resizing (Success Criterion 1.4.4 - Resize Text)
##            â€¢	Text should be scalable up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
##            â€¢	Ensure that resizing text doesn't cause layout issues like overlapping or hidden content.
            ________________________________________
#            3. Responsive Touch Targets (Success Criterion 2.5.5 - Target Size)
##            â€¢	Interactive elements, like buttons and links, should have a minimum target 
##            size of 44x44 CSS pixels to be easily accessible on touch devices.
            ________________________________________
#            4. Adaptable Content and Orientation (Success Criterion 1.3.4 - Orientation)
##            â€¢	Content must work in both portrait and landscape orientations and should not 
##            restrict orientation unless necessary for functionality (e.g., a landscape-specific app).
            ________________________________________
#            5. Meaningful Information Order (Success Criterion 1.3.2 - Meaningful Sequence)
##            â€¢	Ensure content adjusts gracefully without losing its reading order or logical 
##            sequence when resized or viewed on smaller screens.
            ________________________________________
#            6. Support for Multiple Input Methods
##            â€¢	Websites should work seamlessly with various input devices, such as touch 
##            screens, keyboards, or assistive technologies like screen readers. This includes
##             ensuring the focus order remains logical as content adjusts (Success Criterion 2.1.1 - Keyboard).
            ________________________________________
#            7. Contrast and Visibility (Success Criterion 1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum))
##            â€¢	Ensure good contrast between text and background to maintain readability
##             at all sizes and resolutions, especially on smaller screens where smaller
##             fonts might be harder to read.
            ________________________________________
#            8. Avoid Fixed Viewports
##            â€¢	Avoid fixed-width layouts or content that breaks when resized. Use relative 
##            units (like percentages or em/rem) rather than fixed units (like px) for 
##            widths, heights, and font sizes.
